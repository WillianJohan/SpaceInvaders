# SpaceInvaders

I created my own remake of space invaders, inspired by the 1978 version of the game.
Was madedded with Unity 2020.3.11f1 and Universal Render Pipeline (URP)

The whole process was a lot of fun and a lot of learning.
Here, in the GitHub, you can check the source code and the project files but if you want to download and play the final build, go to my [itch.io](https://willianjohan.itch.io/space-invaders-johan)
